ABOUT THE PROGRAM
<ul>
  <li>The program converts text to "Whale Language".</li>
  <li>"Whale Language" has only vowel sounds, excluding the “y” sound. Therefore, the language has no consonant sounds.</li>
  <li>The "u" and "e" sounds in the language are extra long, hence, they are doubled in the program.</li>
  <li>In the future, audio, which will be sung slowly will be added to the program to mimic real whale sound.</li>
</ul>
